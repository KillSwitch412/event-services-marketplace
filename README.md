# 🛒 Online Marketplace for Event Related Services

This project is the updated version of my sophomore year project [Online Marketplace for Event Related Services](https://github.com/KillSwitch412/online-event-service-marketplace-flutter) which communicated with a nodejs server (hosted locally) and MySQL database.

This is not just an update but a complete revamp of the previous project; this version features new UI, also includes both dark and light mode, and is now connected to a nodeJS server and a mongoDB database which are both hosted on the cloud, upgraded security, with more features planned.

## 📃 Description
