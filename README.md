## Working

This project was divided into 2 subprojects. The application and the server. This repo contains the application. The server is built by me using NodeJS and ExpressJS, and is deployed on vercel. The server repo is not public due to security reasons. The database is hosted on mongodb atlas cluster.

The application uses bloc architecture...
